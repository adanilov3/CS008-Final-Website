        <p>Knitwear has been around in people's lives worldwide for a very long time, and has become a widespread practice of leisure. 
            The process of knitting involves continuously knotting or interlinking a series of loops of yarn using needles. These loops 
            are then connected into the previous structure of loops. The new stich secures the loop structure by locking the previous 
            stitches, eventually making a two-dimensional fabric. Knitting is usually done by hand or machines. Hand-knitting is either 
            done with straight needles for flat knitting, which creates a flat fabric, or circular needles for circular knitting which 
            creates a "tubular" shaped fabric. Knitwear can have different elasticities, absorbency and insulation whcih makes it 
            extremely functional. Knitters can choose from many different kinds of stitches and yarn types and colors which makes 
            it a super fun creative process that anyone can learn!</p>

        <p>Hand knitting has been practiced for thousands of years, but the origin is still a mystery. Some believe that it came to when
            out of man instictively, and others believe it originated somewhere in the Middle East centuries ago. The oldest example of hand
            knitting was found in Egypt in 1100 A.D, and it was a pair of socks that used the technique "nålbindning", which uses one needle
            to splice and knot string together (very similar to sewing). Knitting uses two needles to make loops within loops with string, 
            but both knitting and nalbinding create the same sort of fabric. An early example of double-needle knitting was found, another 
            pair of socks that origniated from North Africa in about 1100-1300.</p>
        <p>Due to archaelogical finds and suviving tax lists, it is also known that knitting spread across Europe in most likely the 14th 
            century. European knitting is that it was mostly confined to the very rich, very royal or very religious. the first pieces of 
            European knitting were found in the tomb of Prince Fernando de la Cerdo of Spain. which were silk pillow covers that date to around 1275 AD. 
            The manufacture of knitted caps was so important in England that Parliament passed an act called "The Cappers Act" in 1571. The act said every 
            person above the age of six on Sundays and holidays should wear "a Cap of Wool knit, thicked and dressed in England,
            made within this Realm, and only dressed and finished by some of the Trade of Cappers, upon pain to forfeit
            for every Day of not wearing three Shillings four Pence" which helped sustain knitted cap production and those employed by it.
            This is a great example of what cultural impacts knitting has had. The world of knitting eventually developed and expanded as a trade.

        <p>Knitting was passed through nations by the European Colonizers during the industrial revolution, and it eventually developed into 
            a fashion statement that any and all could enjoy. "It is interesting to watch the renaissance of knitting. Different techniques from
            different parts of the world are being combined. Specialty yarns have been created from different fibers. These new yarns produce
            stunning results. Companies are aspiring to make their knitting patterns the height of fashion. Celebrities have been seen knitting,
            which helps to popularize the revival of the art of knitting. Manufacturers and designers are working together to stimulate interest 
            and creativity within this craft."
