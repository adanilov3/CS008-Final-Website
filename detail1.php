        <h2>Garter Stitch Scarf</h2>
        <p>Something I urge all knitters to try- and am currently doing myself- is to sit and knit an entire scarf.
        Particularly the garter stitch we mentioned in the Basic Stiches section <a href="/detail2.php">here,</a>
        you will want to practice getting the tension right and learning to create even stitches across a lot of rows.
        I reccomend following this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-WK7VveyqQ" target="_blank">tutorial.</a>
        The repetition of doing the same thing over and over again will make your knitting faster and more efficient!</p>

        <h2>Leg Warmers</h2>
        <p>This is a super cute and fun way to introduce yourself to tubular knitting. You would need to get yourself a
            pair of circular needles, which are just two needles connected with wire. These don't have to have some sort
            of complicated stitch! I reccomend this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AO7Tle8Oss" target="_blank">tutorial.</a>
            Once you have mastered circular knitting, you could take on more difficult projects like sweaters, hats, dresses,
        the possibilities are endless!</p>

        <h2>Pillow Case</h2>
        <p>A pilow case is a great example of something you could knit that is not clothing! An easy method of
            knitting together a couple of knitted squares can construct a unique piece to add to your collection!
            I reccomend this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liAqCCfk2qQ" target="_blank">tutorial.</a>
        I imagine going to sleep at night with something that you created beneath your head is a very peaceful sleep... am I right?</p>
